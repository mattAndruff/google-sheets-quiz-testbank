How to make a quiz from a google sheet.
This is all based off me watching this guys video on how to do this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKliSlFZfV4&ab_channel=RogerBurrows  
If you appreciate this functionality, please go over to his channel and subscribe/give him a thumbs up.

Thank you Roger Burrows.

I modified the sheet to truly randomize the order of the questions, and to allow multiple correct answers, and more than 4 distractors.  Everything else is documented on his youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKliSlFZfV4&ab_channel=RogerBurrows

I've included my code attached and example google sheet so you can get a feeling for how to create the columns.
